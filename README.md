## Downstream/Upstream:

In water, the direction along the stream is called downstream. And, the direction against the stream is called upstream.

If the speed of a boat in still water is u km/hr and the speed of the stream is v km/hr, then:

Speed downstream = (u + v) km/hr.

Speed upstream = (u - v) km/hr.

If the speed downstream is a km/hr and the speed upstream is b km/hr, then:

Speed in still water =	1	(a + b) km/hr.
2
Rate of stream =	1	(a - b) km/hr.

### 5) What is the LCM of 147/64 and 30/44?

1) 735/2

2) 735/704

3) 3/704

4) 3/735



Solution

Option A

Find the LCM of the numerators.

LCM (147, 30) = 1470

Step 2: Find the HCF of denominators.

HCF (64, 44) = 4

So, the LCM of 147/64 and 30/44 is (LCM of Numerators) / (HCF of Denominators) = 1470 / 4 = 735/2

### 4) A man rows a boat at a speed of 15 mph in still water. Find the speed of the river if it takes her 4 hours 30 minutes to row a boat to a place 30 miles away and return.

A) 5 mph

B) 10 mph

C) 12 mph

D) 20 mph



Solution

Option C

Let the speed of the river=x mph, then

Time taken row 30 miles upstream and 30 miles downstream = 30/(15-x) + 30/(15+x) = 9/2

= 10/(15-x) + 10/(15+x) = 3/2

= 2[10(15+x) + 10(15-x)] = 3(15-x)²

= 300 + 20x + 300 – 20x = 675 -3x²

x² = 25 or x=5

### 9) Working 5 hours a day, A can Complete a work in 8 days and working 6 hours a day, B can complete the same work in 10 days. Working 8 hours a day, they can jointly complete the work in how many days?

A) 3 days

B) 4 days

C) 4.5 days

D) 5.4 days



Solution

option A

Working 5 hours a day, A can complete the work in 8 days = 5*8 = 40 hours

Working 6 hours a day, B can complete the work in 10 days = 6*10 = 60 hours

(A+B)’s 1 hour’s work = (1/40+1/60)

=(3+2)/120

= 1/24

Hence, A and B can complete the work in 24 hours which is equal to 3 days.

### 11) A mixture of 40 liters of milk and water contains 10% water. How much water should be added to this so that water may be 20% in the new mixture?

A) 6.5 liters

B) 5 liters

C) 4 liters

D) 7.5 liters



Solution

Option B

A mixture of 40 liters of milk = 36 liters of Milk and 4 liters of water = 90:10 ratio

Now the new mixture should be in the ratio of 80:20

Hence 80% is equivalent to 36 liters (no addition of milk is done)

100% is (36/80)*100 = 45 liters of milk is present in the new mixture

Thus water shall be added= (45 – 36 – 4) = 5 liters of water
