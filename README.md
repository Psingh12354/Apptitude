## Downstream/Upstream:

In water, the direction along the stream is called downstream. And, the direction against the stream is called upstream.

If the speed of a boat in still water is u km/hr and the speed of the stream is v km/hr, then:

Speed downstream = (u + v) km/hr.

Speed upstream = (u - v) km/hr.

If the speed downstream is a km/hr and the speed upstream is b km/hr, then:

Speed in still water =	1	(a + b) km/hr.
2
Rate of stream =	1	(a - b) km/hr.
