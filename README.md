## Downstream/Upstream:

In water, the direction along the stream is called downstream. And, the direction against the stream is called upstream.

If the speed of a boat in still water is u km/hr and the speed of the stream is v km/hr, then:

Speed downstream = (u + v) km/hr.

Speed upstream = (u - v) km/hr.

If the speed downstream is a km/hr and the speed upstream is b km/hr, then:

Speed in still water =	1	(a + b) km/hr.
2
Rate of stream =	1	(a - b) km/hr.

### 5) What is the LCM of 147/64 and 30/44?

1) 735/2

2) 735/704

3) 3/704

4) 3/735



Solution

Option A

Find the LCM of the numerators.

LCM (147, 30) = 1470

Step 2: Find the HCF of denominators.

HCF (64, 44) = 4

So, the LCM of 147/64 and 30/44 is (LCM of Numerators) / (HCF of Denominators) = 1470 / 4 = 735/2

### 4) A man rows a boat at a speed of 15 mph in still water. Find the speed of the river if it takes her 4 hours 30 minutes to row a boat to a place 30 miles away and return.

A) 5 mph

B) 10 mph

C) 12 mph

D) 20 mph



Solution

Option C

Let the speed of the river=x mph, then

Time taken row 30 miles upstream and 30 miles downstream = 30/(15-x) + 30/(15+x) = 9/2

= 10/(15-x) + 10/(15+x) = 3/2

= 2[10(15+x) + 10(15-x)] = 3(15-x)²

= 300 + 20x + 300 – 20x = 675 -3x²

x² = 25 or x=5

### 9) Working 5 hours a day, A can Complete a work in 8 days and working 6 hours a day, B can complete the same work in 10 days. Working 8 hours a day, they can jointly complete the work in how many days?

A) 3 days

B) 4 days

C) 4.5 days

D) 5.4 days



Solution

option A

Working 5 hours a day, A can complete the work in 8 days = 5*8 = 40 hours

Working 6 hours a day, B can complete the work in 10 days = 6*10 = 60 hours

(A+B)’s 1 hour’s work = (1/40+1/60)

=(3+2)/120

= 1/24

Hence, A and B can complete the work in 24 hours which is equal to 3 days.

### 11) A mixture of 40 liters of milk and water contains 10% water. How much water should be added to this so that water may be 20% in the new mixture?

A) 6.5 liters

B) 5 liters

C) 4 liters

D) 7.5 liters



Solution

Option B

A mixture of 40 liters of milk = 36 liters of Milk and 4 liters of water = 90:10 ratio

Now the new mixture should be in the ratio of 80:20

Hence 80% is equivalent to 36 liters (no addition of milk is done)

100% is (36/80)*100 = 45 liters of milk is present in the new mixture

Thus water shall be added= (45 – 36 – 4) = 5 liters of water

### 12) Four different electronic devices make a beep after every 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3/2 hour and 1 hour 45 minutes respectively. All the devices beeped together at 12 noon. They will again beep together at:

A) 12 midnight

B) 3 a.m

C) 6 a.m

D) 9 a.m



Solution

Option D

Four different devices beep after every 30 mins, 60 mins, 90 mins and 105 mins.

LCM of 30,60,90 and 105 is 1260.

Which means the devices beep together after every 1260 mins = 1260/60 = 21 hours

Hence 12 noon + 21 hours = 9 a.m

### 13) In a 100 m race, A can beat B by 25 m and B can beat C by 4 m. In the same race, A can beat C by?

A) 21 m

B) 26 m

C) 28 m

D) 29 m



Solution

Option C

When A travels 100 m, B travels 75 m. Hence A:B = 100:75

When B travels 100 m, C travels 96 m. Hence B:C = 100:96

When B Travels 75 m, C travels (96 x 75)/100 = 72 m

Hence B:C = 75:72.

Therefore, A:B:C = 100:75:72.

So, when A Travels 100 m, C travels 72 m.

Therefore, A beat C by 28 m

### 14) In an examination, 70% of students passed in physics, 65% in chemistry, 27% failed in both subjects. The percentage of students who passed is?

A) 62

B) 68

C) 66

D) 69



Solution

Option A

70% students passed in physics = 30% failed in Physics.

65% students passed in Chemistry = 35% failed in Chemistry

Percentage of students failed in both subject = 27%.

Percentage of students failed = 35 + 30 – 27

= 38%.

Percentage of students passed = 100 – 38% = 62%

### 15) If 15 oxen or 20 cows can eat the grass of a field in 80 days, then in how many days will 6 oxen and 2 cows eat the same grass?

A) 40

B) 60

C)100

D) 160



Solution

Option D

15 oxen take 80 days so, 6 oxen take x days

x = 15*80/6 = 200 days

20 oxen also take 80 day. So, 2 cows take y days

y = 20*80/2 = 800 days

Together work will be done in 800*200/(800+200) = 160 days

### 16) Simplify {(3 * 2.333 + 2)/3} / (1/10 of 100 + 4.8181)

A) 297/10377

B) 188/121

C) 21/34

D) 33/163



Solution

Solution: Option D

### 17) In how many ways can 6 lottery tickets be distributed among 4 different people if all of the four different people can get any number of tickets?

A) 6C4

B) 6P4

C) 4^6

D) 6^4

Solution 
C is correct because all 4 can get 4 ticket one by one

### 19) A salesman has the liberty to sell a hair dryer in his store at a price between Rs. 300 and Rs. 700. Profit earned by selling the hair dryer for Rs. 650 is twice the loss incurred when it is sold for Rs. 350. What is the cost price of the hair dryer?

A) 550

B) 450

C) 350

D) 150



Solution

Option B

Going through the options,

Taking Cost Price as Rs 450.

Profit = 650 – 450 = 200

Loss = 350 – 450 = 100

Clearly profit is twice the loss incurred.

Hence, Rs 450 is the correct option.

### 20) Ronald and Elan are working on an assignment. Ronald takes 6 hours to type 32 pages on a computer, while Elan takes 5 hours to type 40 pages. How much time will they take, working together on two different computers to type an assignment of 110 pages?

A) 7 hours 30 minutes

B) 8 hours

C) 8 hours 15 minutes

D) 8 hours 25 minutes



Solution

Option C

In 1hr, Ronald types = 32/6 pages and Elan types = 40/5 pages

If they work together they will type = 32/6 + 40/5 = 40/3 pages in 1 hr

Time needed  to complete the assignment is = (3 x 110)/40 = 33/4 = 8hrs 15mins

Hence, the time required is 8 hrs 15 mins.

### 21) A television manufacturing company has decided to increase the sale to beat the economic slowdown. It decides to reduce the price of television sets by 25% as a result of which the sales increased by 20%. What is the effect on the total revenue of the company?

A) Decreased by 20%

B) Increased by 20%

C) Increased by 10%

D) Decreased by 10%



Solution

Option D

Let the initial Price = Rs.100 and initial sales = 100

So, the initial revenue = Rs. 10000

Now, the price is reduced to 25% which is equal to Rs.75 and Sales is increased by 20% which is equal to 120.

Now new revenue = 120 x 75 = Rs. 9000

Change in revenue = (10000 – 9000) = Rs.1000 decrease

% decrease = (1000/10000) x 100 = 10%

Hence, the correct option is decrease of 10%.

### 22) Ravi has a bag full of 10 Nestle and 5 Cadbury chocolates. Out of these, he draws two chocolates. What is the probability that he would get at least one Nestle chocolate?

A) 19/21

B) 3/7

C) 2/21

D) 1/3



Solution

Option A

Probability of getting atleast one nestle chocolate = [(10C1 x 5C1) + 10C2] / 15C2

[(10 x 5) + (10 x 9)/2] / [(15 x 14)/2] = 19/21.

Hence, the required probability is 19/21.
